# Calorie Estimation & Benefits for Physiotherapy Chatbot

## Overview
This section provides guidelines for estimating calorie burn and highlighting the benefits of different physiotherapy exercises. The chatbot will use user-specific data such as *weight, age, duration, and intensity* to generate personalized estimates.

## 1. Key Factors for Calorie Calculation
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*User Weight* ‚Üí Heavier individuals burn more calories for the same activity.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Exercise Intensity* ‚Üí Light, moderate, or intense movements affect expenditure.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Duration* ‚Üí Longer sessions lead to higher calorie burn.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Body Part Involvement* ‚Üí Full-body workouts burn more compared to isolated movements.

## 2. Example Calorie Estimates (per 30 minutes)
| Exercise Type            | Light Effort (kcal) | Moderate Effort (kcal) | High Effort (kcal) |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Seated Leg Raises       | 40-50              | 60-70                | 80-90            |
| Shoulder Rotations      | 30-40              | 50-60                | 70-80            |
| Resistance Band Work    | 60-70              | 90-100               | 120-140          |
| Balance Exercises       | 50-60              | 75-85                | 100-120          |
| Core Strengthening      | 70-80              | 100-110              | 130-150          |

## 4. Example User Query & Chatbot Response
### *User:* "How many calories will I burn doing knee exercises for 20 minutes?"
### *Chatbot Response:*  
"For a *70 kg individual*, here‚Äôs the estimated calorie burn:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Seated Leg Raises (Moderate Effort):* ~45 kcal
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Heel Slides (Moderate Effort):* ~40 kcal
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Wall Sits (Moderate Effort):* ~55 kcal

üî• Total estimated burn: *140 kcal* in 20 minutes.
‚úÖ Health Benefits: Strengthens knee joints, improves mobility, and reduces stiffness."
